APPLICATION=Processes Extension

V2.02:

22-May-2013 - Added possibility to kill a specific session

V2.01:

12-Sep-2011 - Process details now display every column in the V$SESSION
              column, including new fields added in 9i, 10g and 11g.

31-Aug-2011 - Added sorting to process overview table

            - Fixed (again) the popup window selector, now SID/SERIAL# combo is
              used to select the clicked process. Also the LongOps view is
              fixed, now we show only entries whose TIME_REMAINING field is
              not 0.

13-Jul-2010 - Changed layout of Process overview page to use jQuery UI tabs.

            - Added 2 new views inside the process overview called Top 20 CPU
              and Top 20 Wait, which shows the top 20 processes consuming most
              of the CPU time and the Top 20 waiting processes. Both queries
              are taken from Uwe Hesse, an Oracle OCM. See this URL:
