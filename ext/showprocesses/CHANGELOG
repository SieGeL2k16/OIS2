APPLICATION=Processes Extension

V2.01:

13-Jul-2010 - Changed layout of Process overview page to use jQuery UI tabs.

            - Added 2 new views inside the process overview called Top 20 CPU
              and Top 20 Wait, which shows the top 20 processes consuming most
              of the CPU time and the Top 20 waiting processes. Both queries
              are taken from Uwe Hesse, an Oracle OCM. See this URL:
