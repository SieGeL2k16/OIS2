APPLICATION=Schema Viewer

V2.01:

21-Oct-2011 - Added overview of the total size of a selected schema. This is
              achived by counting both DBA_SEGMENTS and DBA_OBJECT_SIZE views.
              Note that this shows the allocated space, not the real usage,
              which is normally less the allocated space.

V2.00:

26-Dec-2010 - Schema viewer is now functional. Works completly via AJAX
              and allows to view the DDL of any object if the PL/SQL package
              DBMS_METADATA is available (should be the case since 9i)

20-Dec-2010 - Initial version of plugin.
